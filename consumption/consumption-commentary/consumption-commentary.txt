 After a 6.6 percent and 12.6 percent month-over-month decline in March and April, personal spending increased 8.2 percent in May and consensus expects just a 5.4 percent increase in June. The report also showed a slower rebound in services spending. Spending on goods in May grew 14.1 percent, while services spending was just 5.2 percent. 

One positive take-away from the Personal Income & Spending report is the surge in the personal savings rate. In April, consumers saved 32.2 percent of their income. The May report saw the savings rate fall to 23.2 percent, but even this is well above the high single-digit range than has been common over the last several years. These accumulated savings have created a large reservoir of potential spending. If consumers feel confident in the second half of the year, we may see a substantial surge in consumer spending.
