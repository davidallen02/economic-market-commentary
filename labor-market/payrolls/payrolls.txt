In March and April the nonfarm payrolls fell by a combined 22 million, erasing decades of gains. The Leisure & Hospitality category, which includes the hard hit restaurant and hotel industries, saw employment cut in half from the level in February. As lockdown conditions eased and government incentives to maintain employment reached businesses, the labor market has seen a remarkable turnaround. After adding 2.7 million jobs in April, labor market gains accelerated to 4.8 million in May - both of which set new records for monthly gains. To put this in context, the gain in May exceeded the cumulative gain for every year on record. However, despite these incredible gains in the second quarter, employment is still well below pre-pandemic levels. In June total seasonally adjusted employment was 14.7 million below the pre-pandemic high reached in February. Put another way, nonfarm employment in June was just 90 percent of the previous peak.
