The May Employment Situation showed that payrolls gains accelerated from the disappointing total in April. However, the 559,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls was still below expectations. The decline in labor force participation was also troubling given that economic and survey data point to strong labor demand from employers. If participation were held constant at the pre-pandemic level, the unemployment rate would be higher than the 5.8 percent reported. We believe that several factors are keeping people from finding employment including the availability of more generous unemployment benefits and issues with child care. If the imbalance between supply and demand persists employers will likely need to increase wages to attract more labor supply.
