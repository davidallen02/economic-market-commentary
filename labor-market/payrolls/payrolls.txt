Though the labor market has seen extraordinary job growth in the second quarter, conditions are still dismal. In the second quarter, monthly payroll growth averaged 1.3 million after losing a net 13.3 million jobs in the first quarter. The labor market is still 10.7 million jobs short of the pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate has declined to 7.9 percent from 11.1 percent at the end of the first quarter and Aprilâ€™s 14.7 percent. Though improving, this is still an extraordinarily high level. Since 1948, the official unemployment rate has met or exceeded this level only 10 percent of the time. There are also worrying signs that the unemployed are increasingly losing touch with the labor market. For instance, labor force participation has declined two percentage points from the January level and shows signs of stagnating at these low levels.
