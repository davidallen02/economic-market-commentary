Though the labor market has seen extraordinary job growth in the second quarter, conditions are still dismal. Over the last seven months, monthly payroll growth has averaged 1.8 million after losing a net 22.2 million jobs in the March and April. The labor market is still 9.8 million jobs short of the pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate has declined to 6.7 percent from 11.1 percent at the end of the first quarter and Aprilâ€™s 14.7 percent. Though improving, this is still an extraordinarily high level. There are also worrying signs that the unemployed are increasingly losing touch with the labor market. For instance, labor force participation has nearly declined two percentage points from the January level and shows signs of stagnating at these low levels.
