We expected the April Employment Situation would signal that the economy had entered a new phase in its recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Economists estimated the report would show that one million jobs during the month. However, just 266 thousand jobs were added in April. From a historical perspective, this is an extraordinary number of jobs to add in a single month, but it was a historic miss relative to expectations. Moreover, it was significantly weaker than the gain in March which was revised down to 770 thousand in the April report. We believe that several factors are keeping people from finding employment including the availability of more generous unemployment benefits and issues with child care. Demand for labor remains high, and wages may need to rise until labor supply normalizes.
