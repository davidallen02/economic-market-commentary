Job gains have accelerated as public health conditions have improved. In March the labor market added  916 thousand jobs, including more than 280 thousand jobs in the hard-hit Leisure & Hospitality industries. We expect strong monthly job growth as the labor market closes the 8.4 million remaining deficit to the pre-pandemic level of payrolls. These gains will push the unemployment rate lower. However, the unemployment rate does not reflect the declines in labor force participation rates we seen during the pandemic. Though overall participation and prime-age participation have risen from their pandemic lows, they still remain below pre-pandemic levels. For this reason, we believe the broader underemployment rate will better reflect the amount of remaining slack in the labor market for the foreseeable future.
