The recovery of the US economy continued into the first quarter of 2021. The economy grew an annualized 6.4 percent, following 33.4 percent and 4.3 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Personal consumption was supported by two rounds of direct transfers to households during the period. Overall consumption increased an annualized 11.3 percent from the prior quarter and is now just shy of the pre-pandemic level. Growth should continue to accelerate as higher immunization levels allow social distancing restrictions to be relaxed and households spend down their significant accumulation of excess savings.
