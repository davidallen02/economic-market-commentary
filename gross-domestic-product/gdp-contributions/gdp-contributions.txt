As expected, economic output declined at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter. The economy declined by nearly a third at a seasonally adjusted annualized pace. The decline in the period was broad based but led by the consumer. Personal consumption declined by 34.6 percent. Fixed investment fell 29.9 percent. Government spending made a small positive contribution in the period as did international trade. However, with imports down, private inventory levels declined which led a to 4 percentage point negative contribution from the category.
