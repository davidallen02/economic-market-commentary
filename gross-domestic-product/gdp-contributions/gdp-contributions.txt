The full weight of the coronavirus weighed on US economic output during the second quarter. The economy contracted an annualized 31.4 percent from the first quarter. The 33.4 percent rebound in the third quarter was as dramatic. Personal consumption grew at a 41.0 percent annualized pace and accounted for about three-quarters of the total growth in the economy. Fixed investment and inventory replenishment both made positive contributions, while international trade subtracted roughly 3 percentage points from overall growth. Total economic output remains 2.4 percent below the pre-pandemic level.
